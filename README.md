# Neo-6m-gps-code
"Arduino Uno project for real-time GPS tracking using the Neo6M module. Captures and prints raw GPS data to the Serial Monitor via SoftwareSerial (pins 8 and 9). Developed in Arduino IDE."
"This Arduino Uno project reads live GPS data from the Neo6M GPS module using SoftwareSerial on pins 8 and 9. It forwards the raw GPS NMEA sentences to the Serial Monitor for real-time location tracking. Developed in Arduino IDE, with a baud rate of 115200 for monitoring and 9600 for GPS communication."
Here are the connections for your setup:

Neo6M GPS Module to Arduino Uno:

VCC ‚Üí 3.3V or 5V (Check your module‚Äôs voltage rating)
GND ‚Üí GND
TX ‚Üí Pin 8 (RX of Arduino)
RX ‚Üí Pin 9 (TX of Arduino)
Serial Monitor Settings:
Baud Rate: 115200

This Arduino sketch enables communication between an Arduino board and a SIM800L GSM module using the SoftwareSerial library. It acts as a simple serial bridge, allowing you to send and receive AT commands and view responses through the Arduino IDE's Serial Monitor.

üìã Features
Reads data from the SIM800L GSM module.
Displays module output directly in the Arduino Serial Monitor.
Simple interface for sending AT commands manually.

üß∞ Hardware Required
Arduino Uno (or any compatible board)
SIM800L GSM Module
Jumper wires
Power source (suitable for SIM800L, e.g., 3.7V Li-ion battery or buck converter)

üîå Circuit Connections
SIM800L Pin	Arduino Pin
TX	8 (rxPin)
RX	9 (txPin)
GND	GND
VCC	3.7V ‚Äì 4.2V (‚ö†Ô∏è Not 5V)
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: SIM800L is sensitive to power fluctuations. Use a stable power supply (not directly from Arduino 5V pin).

üß™ How It Works
Uses SoftwareSerial on pins 8 (RX) and 9 (TX) to communicate with SIM800L.
Initializes two serial channels:
Serial for the Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
gpsSerial for SIM800L (9600 baud)
Continuously reads data from SIM800L and writes it to the Serial Monitor.

üìü How to Use
Upload the code to your Arduino.
Open Serial Monitor (set baud rate to 115200).
Type AT commands (if desired) and view responses from SIM800L.
Example: AT ‚Üí should return OK
Example: AT+CSQ ‚Üí returns signal strength
